    "\n",
    "Blood donation is an extremely important contribution that a person can make towards the society because donating blood does not only save lives of people who need blood, it also has beneficial for donors themselves. Every day, people lose blood in accidents, injuries and surgeries, and then urgently need fresh blood to compensate for the loss so, there is a high demand for donors who are ready to donate their blood. \n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting if a donor will donate blood in the future can help in finding blood donation easily. Therefore, in this project, I will apply machine learning techniques on data collected from Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan. The goal of this project is to construct a model that predict whether or not a blood donor will give blood in future."
